# ðŸŽ“ Student Dropout Prediction Model

Project Overview

This project develops and deploys a machine learning model designed to predict the risk of a student dropping out of an academic program. By analyzing key academic and demographic metrics, the model provides an intervention score (High Risk or Low Risk), enabling academic advisors to proactively engage with vulnerable students.

The model is built using Scikit-learn and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

# ðŸš€ Deployment and Usage

The model is deployed via a simple Streamlit interface, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive real-time predictions.
